Follow the following steps with a proxy-free connection:

(I) Make an account on IBM Bluemix through "https://developer.ibm.com/sso/bmregistration?ca=dw-_-cognitive-_-TPC2017-_-IndiaWS2". If this doesn't work try through "https://console.bluemix.net/" . 
Fill the details, and make sure you have filled the organization name and space name (these should be unique, like your username).

(II) Set-up Bluemix CLI on your system

1) download the bluemix cli tar. (https://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html)
2) For Ubuntu, unzip, and run the install command (./install_bluemix_cli) and follow step 3.
   For Windows, just install and skip step 3.
3) Add the bin folder to PATH variable to use 'bx' command globally. Use the following commands on terminal
   a) gedit ~/.profile
   b) Find the line 
	PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
   c) Replace this line with 
	PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH:<LOACTION_OF_BIN_FOLDER>"
		e.g. For me, it looks like 
			PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH:/home/mayank/Bluemix_CLI/bin"
   d) Save the changes.
4) Add the api end point, I have used the UK organization loacation so my command looks like (you can use the exact same command)
	bluemix api https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net
5) Use the command "bx login" to login on your system and complete the formalities by selecting everything with default values
6) Use the following command to input your target and space name on your terminal. These are also visible on the top-right corner of your bluemix console homepage after login.
	bx target -o <ORGANIZATION_NAME> -s <SPACE_NAME>

(III) Upload/push your project code

1) 'cd' into your app root directory, for mobile app developers, you need to cd into your server's root directory as that will be the one getting hosted on the cloud.
2) Run the command 'bx cf push app-name', app-name can be anything, just make sure it is unique and url friendly. ( like codefest-testapp ) You will get an error if your app-name is already taken.
3)If everything run's smooth, you shall be provided with a url using which you can acess the app. This URL is available on your Bluemix console homepage.

my app link: 'http://codefest-testapp.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/'


To update the code, make changes to your code and repead the process under step (III) with the same app-name.


NOTE: Those who are making Django app need to install Django buildpacks on the Bluemix server manually, as Django is not a part of the default buildpacks available on Bluemix.
